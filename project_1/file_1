The CIA Triad: A Pillar of Cybersecurity
The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in cybersecurity that ensures data protection and system integrity. It stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which are the three key principles of cybersecurity.

Confidentiality 
Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users. 

Integrity
Integrity protects data from being altered or corrupted. 

Availability
Availability ensures that data and systems remain accessible when needed.

Cyber Threats:
Some common cyber threats include;
Phishing
 In phishing, attackers trick users into giving away personal information through fake emails or websites. 
Prevention
- Verify email senders before clicking on links.
- Avoid downloading attachments from unknown sources.
- Use email security filters and anti-phishing tools.

Malware

Prevention

Prevention
- Back Up Your Files – Save important files on an external hard drive or cloud storage so you don’t lose them if attacked.
- Avoid Suspicious Links & Emails.
Use Strong Security Software – Install a good antivirus and keep it updated to detect and block threats.
